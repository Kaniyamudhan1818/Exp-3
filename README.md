# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and draw UML diagrams for the Railway Management System

# SRS (Procedure):
1.Identify main actors such as Passenger, Admin, and Ticket Clerk.

2.Determine key functions like Book Ticket, Cancel Ticket, Check Schedule, and Update Train Details.

3.Draw the Use Case Diagram linking actors with their respective functions.

4.Create Class, Sequence, and Activity Diagrams to illustrate data flow and operations.

5.Verify relationships and ensure all system interactions are clearly represented.
